# javascript-pig-game
1) Pig Game, implemented using Javascripts DOM Manipulation concepts. Rules are as below:
2) The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
3) In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
4) BUT, if the player rolls a 1 on any one of the dice (or both), all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
5) The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
6) The first player to reach 100 points (or the custom score that user set) on GLOBAL score wins the game!!
